A single, gnarled hand gripped a steaming mug of tea, its warmth a small defiance against the biting wind. Below, the waves crashed against the jagged rocks, each boom a metronome for the furious dance of the clouds. He had seen a thousand storms, but this one felt differentâ€”heavier, charged with a silence that seemed to swallow the usual roar. A stray cat, a ginger tabby with a torn ear, rubbed against his leg, purring a low, rumbling song of contentment. It was a strange juxtaposition: the violent chaos outside and the quiet peace within the small, circular room."
